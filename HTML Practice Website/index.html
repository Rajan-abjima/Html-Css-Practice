         <h3>Film Making</h3>
            <p>Making a film takes a very complex process. This is why films sometimes take months and even years to <br>
                make. Filmmaking is always broken up into 5 steps. Filmmaking takes a process of the development of the <br>
                film, the pre-production, production, the post-production, and distribution. This is when the production <br>
                begins to take shape. Ideas for the film are created and the screenplay is written and edited. During this part <br>
                of the process financing is planned out and looked at what can be afforded.
